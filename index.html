       <p>My name is Endless Thao, I'm currently studying in Quality Assurance Class of 28 of Year Up. Some technology skills that I have learned during the time I have started school would have to be learning how to use Execl. Having the basic knowledge of the Python coding language, along with practicing coding. Some of the areas I find myself interested in would have to be Data Analyst due to finding using Excel interesting to rearrange how you organized data and how to look at data. What I hope to achieve over the next few months of this program is to get better at communicating, and how to present presentations. In order to succeed in my internships that I hope to receive in what I'm looking for. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching shows and enjoying time with my family.  </p>
